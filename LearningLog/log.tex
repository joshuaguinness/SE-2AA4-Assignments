	- Looked through the repo and the resources contained within
	- Started a 40 min python video where it goes through the entire language
	- Read through the assignment 

Monday, January 14, 2019:
	- Started to go over doxygen and tried to generate a pdf of the Box3D example
	- Installed doxygen

Tuesday, January 15, 2019:
	- Continued going through the doxygen tutorial
	- Ran into and issue where pulling from the remote repo ended up with a blank Box3D python file on my local machine
	- Restarted my command line and it started to work again
	- Tried to generate the PDF, but the makefile did not work, realized it was because I did not have the correct version of doxygen installed so I installed the correct version
	- Coded the first 3 functions of Step 1 of the assignment
	- Took a while to get back into the habbit of coding in python but the first three functions of step 1, are tested and commented

Wednesday, January 16, 2018
	- Continued working on assignment 1
	- Finished the first three functions of step 2 and halfway done the last function of step 2
	- Just need to allocate the rest of people who do not have free choice
	- Grew in my understanding of python, especially about dictionaries and lists
	- Ran into problems with trying to fiture out how to do certain things, but after doing some searching and trying/testing I figured it out

Friday, January 18, 2019
	- Finished the read allocation data in the morning and did some testing
	- Finished programing the allocate function
	- Created various test files and test cases
	- Test cases pass and functions are good
	- Added doxygen commenting to functions
	- Ran into an issue right before I was going to submit where make test did not work

Thursday, January 24, 2019
	- Fixed the problem of make test not working by putting the folder with all my test files in the A1 directory
	- Started writing my report

Friday, January 25, 2019
	- Finished writing the reflection on my report
	- Really enjoyed writing the report and being able to reflect on what I worked on and how it could have been improved

Sunday, February 10, 2019
	- Caught up in lectures, learning about MIS	
	- Programmed the first module of assignment #1

Monday, February 11, 2019
	- Finished the programming of Assignment #2, learning all about reading formal specifications, lambda functions
	and writing object oriented code in python
	- Learned how pytest works although didn't get that much of an opportunity to implement it

Monday, February 25, 2019
	- Added 15 test cases for Assignment #2 part 1
	- used the test cases to test my code and partners code
	- Finished writing the report



TODO:
- Go back and write what learned each week
- Format into an actual tex file
