\maketitle

The way this document is structured is that each subsection refers to a given week within the associated dates. At the start of each subsection will be an overview of what I learned that week through lecture. The associated subsubsections will talk more in depth about specific work on assignments or studying for midterm/exam that I did on a certain days. These specific subsubsections will also talk about struggles I had, problems I solved, and milestones I reached.
